        desc: 'Ants are social insects belonging to the family Formicidae, with over 12,000 known species found worldwide. They live in structured colonies that can range from a few dozen individuals to millions, depending on the species. Ants communicate using pheromones and work together to gather food, defend their nests, and care for their young. While many ants are harmless or even beneficial to ecosystems, some species can become pests by invading homes, contaminating food, or damaging structures.',
        control: 'Pest control professionals use a variety of methods to manage and eliminate ant infestations. Common approaches include the use of bait stations, which attract ants to carry poisoned food back to their colony, ultimately killing the queen and other members. Insecticide sprays may also be applied directly to nests or along ant trails. For more severe infestations, pest control may involve sealing entry points around a building and applying perimeter treatments to prevent future access. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, which combine chemical, physical, and biological controls, are often used to provide long-term, environmentally responsible solutions.'
